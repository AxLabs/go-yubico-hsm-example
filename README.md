# Go example for YubiHSM2 FIPS

This repo laid the groundwork about how to set-up and interact with [YubiHSM2 FIPS](https://www.yubico.com/products/hardware-security-module/) using [Golang](https://go.dev/). This repository also intends to document architectural trade-offs and technical challenges.

 ## What the f*** is an HSM?

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSM traditionally comes in the form of a plug-in or an external device that attaches directly to a computer or network server.

The main purpose of an HSM is to secure cryptographic keys and operations within the device, offering a higher level of security than software-based management because the keys are less susceptible to theft or unauthorized access.

ðŸ‘‰ HSMs are specifically designed to protect the lifecycle of cryptographic keys. Their tamper-resistant physical design ensures that sensitive keys are never exposed outside the module.

ðŸ‘‰ FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) is developed by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability.

ðŸ‘‰ [YubiHSM2 FIPS](https://www.yubico.com/products/hardware-security-module/) product is certified with [FIPS 140-2, Level 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2).

## Install dependencies

- Install yubi-shell: [download page](https://developers.yubico.com/yubihsm-shell/Releases/)

### MacOS

If you don't know where the `yubihsm_pkcs11.dylib` is located, just do:

```shell
sudo find /usr -name "yubihsm_*.dylib" -print
```

### Linux

TBD

## Architecture

In order to better understand the role of all the components and how they communicate, the following picture depicts a high-level architecture.

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/yubihsm-architecture.png)

Important points:

* The logical representation of nodes (i.e., machines) is just an example. All the components places within `Node N`, `Node C1`, and `Node C2`, can be placed in a single node/machine. The separation between 3 different nodes is just for understanding purposes -- mainly to highlight that `Client 2` doesn't require, e.g., `yubihsm-shell`, and that `Client 1` doesn't require, e.g., `yubihsm_pkcs11.so`, and so on.
* The native libraries (green), the connector (purple), and `Client 1` (blue), are distributed with the [YubiHSM2 SDK](https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/).
* An advantage of using PKCS#11 standard to communicate with an HSM is interoperability. Therefore, it doesn't matter what exactly is behind the PKCS#11 interface, since it can be easily replaced without affecting the application implementation.

## YubiHSM Connector

How to configure and stuff

From the developer portal at Yubi website:

> The Connector is not a trusted component. Sessions are established cryptographically between the application and the YubiHSM 2 using a symmetric mutual authentication scheme that is both encrypted and authenticated.

An important aspect about connectivity is also highlighted at the Yubico developer's website:

> The Connector is not required to run on the same host as the applications which access it. In that case the Connector should be configured to be listening on a different address and port rather than the default localhost:12345, making sure that the client has access.

Install:

```shell
yubihsm-connector install
```

Then, 

```shell
sudo yubihsm-connector --config yubihsm-connector-config.yaml start
```

## Useful commands

```shell
yubihsm-shell
```

```shell
yubihsm-shell --authkey=1 --password=password --outformat=hex --action=list-objects
```
